# AWS-Kafka-Demo
TF Demo App to Showcase Kafka Skills

This deployment follows the best practices laid out here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/best-practices-for-running-apache-kafka-on-aws/<br/>
As noted in the article, a fully managed Kafka service exists, but to add extra challenge and demonstration of my skills, I have made this TF repo to manually deploy the cluster.
